Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capacity of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. This field of research in computer science focuses on developing and studying methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] A longstanding debate surrounds whether artificial intelligence genuinely exhibits intelligence or merely simulates it by imitating human-like behaviors.
