Here's my review and suggested improvements:

The chapter starts strong, setting the scene and introducing the protagonist, Dick, in a vivid and immersive way. The descriptions of the lagoon and the island of Karolin are beautiful and effectively transport the reader to the setting. 

However, there are a few areas that could be improved for clarity and flow:

Original: 
"Behind him the breakers of the outer sea thundered and the spindrift scattered on the wind; before him stretched an ocean calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by the fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin."

Improved:
"Behind him, the outer sea's breakers thundered, sending spindrift scattering on the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out, a calm and infinite expanse of blue water, dotted with fishing gulls."

The original sentence is a bit long and has a few phrases that could be rephrased for better clarity.

Original:
"His were the canoes drawn up on the sand and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers."

Improved:
"The canoes drawn up on the sand belonged to him, as did the empty houses that had once harbored the war canoes on their rollers."

This rephrased sentence is more concise and easier to follow.

Original:
"Away there, beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils."

Improved:
"In the distance, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree Island, a place of breathtaking beauty, but also infested with devils."

The original sentence is a bit awkwardly phrased, and the improved version is more concise and evocative.

Original:
"Little Tari the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sitting on the coral close by, looked up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin swept away by war had left the women and the boys and the children like himself defenceless and without a man or leader."

Improved:
"Nearby, Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral, gazing up at Dick. Though still young and inexperienced, Tari understood that the war had taken all the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children like himself without a leader or protector."

The original paragraph could be broken up for better flow and clarity.

Here's the revised chapter:

"The Gates of Morning"

CHAPTER I

THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his eyes fixed on the South.

Behind him, the outer sea's breakers thundered, sending spindrift scattering on the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out, a calm and infinite expanse of blue water, dotted with fishing gulls.

The canoes drawn up on the sand belonged to him, as did the empty houses that had once harbored the war canoes on their rollers. Women, children, and youths – all the tribe – were busy along the beach in the blazing sun, fishing with nets, playing games, or working on the paraka patches. They were all his people.

Then, as he cast his eyes from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow contracted. Turning his back to the lagoon, he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. In the distance, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree Island, a place of breathtaking beauty, but also infested with devils.

Nearby, Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral, gazing up at Dick. Though still young and inexperienced, Tari understood that the war had taken all the men of Karolin, leaving the women, boys, and children like himself without a leader or protector.
