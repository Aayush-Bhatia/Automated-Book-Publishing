"The Gates of Morning"

CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his eyes fixed on the southern horizon. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea thundered, sending spindrift scattering on the wind. Before him, an ocean calm as a lake stretched out, infinite, blue, and dotted with fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.

Enclosed by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea unto itself, prone to storms in heavy winds, yet serene as a lake in light airs. And it was all his—to command, to explore, to protect. He had landed here only yesterday, and now, he was the master of this domain.

As he gazed out at the lagoon, he saw his people busy along the beach, their dark skin glistening in the blazing sun. Women, children, and youths worked together, fishing with nets, playing games, or tending to the paraka patches. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

But as his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed, and he turned his back to the lagoon, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the horizon, invisible but ever-present, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet infested with devils.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, watching him. Tari may have known little of life, but he knew that the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless, without a leader or protector.
