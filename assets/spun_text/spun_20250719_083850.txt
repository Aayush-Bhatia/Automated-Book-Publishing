Here is a rewritten version of the chapter in a fresh, modern, and engaging literary tone:

**The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on the coral ledge, his eyes scanning the southern horizon. Behind him, the breakers crashed against the outer sea, sending spindrift flying on the wind. Before him, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out like a tranquil lake, its infinite blue waters dotted with fishing gulls. This was his domain, and he had only arrived yesterday.

The tribe bustled along the beach, their daily routines unfolding in the blazing sun. Women, children, and youths worked on the paraka patches, fished with nets, or played games. The canoes drawn up on the sand were his, and the empty houses that once held war canoes now stood vacant, waiting for a new purpose.

As Dick's gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. He turned his back to the lagoon, facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Out there, beyond the sea line, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet infested with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, watching Dick with curious eyes. Tari knew that the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women and children defenseless and leaderless.

Yesterday, from the northern sea, a strange boat had arrived, carrying Dick and Katafa, the girl who had been blown away years ago. The women said they had been sent by the gods to be their chief and ruler.

Tari, with the simplicity of childhood, asked the question that had been on his mind: "Taori, who are you?"

Dick's eyes clouded, and he struggled to find the words to explain his past. He couldn't tell Tari about the people beyond the world they knew, about his name, Dick Lestrange, or his life on Marua Island with Katafa and Kearney, the old sailor who had raised him. That was all lost in the haze of his past, consumed by the tropical light and storms of the island.

"I am Taori, Tari tatu," Dick replied, his voice gentle. "Why do you ask?"

Tari's mind flitted to the cries of children hauling in a net, and he darted away, leaving Dick to his thoughts.

As Dick gazed north, the question stirred a memory of the schooner that had been burned by the Melanesian hands, and their escape in the old dinghy. He saw the women and children swarming around him, welcoming him as their chief and leader.

But the beauty of the sea and sky was tainted by the memory of the men they had escaped, who would surely build canoes and come for them. Dick knew that war was a constant threat, and that he needed to prepare the tribe for battle.

As he gazed out to sea, Katafa's hand fell on his shoulder, and he turned to face her. Her eyes were fixed on the northern horizon, where Palm Tree was beginning to materialize through the mirage. They stood in silence, their minds untutored, unaware of the science behind the phenomenon, yet sensing the danger that lurked beyond the sea line.

Their eyes locked onto the island, and they relived the horror of their escape, the yells of the Melanesians, and the wind that filled the sail as they raced for safety. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to repeat the warning: they would come.

Some day, the savages would build canoes and see the lagoon mirror-light in the sky. They would come for the women of Karolin, and Dick knew that he had to prepare for battle. His nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hate.

As the vision of Palm Tree faded, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach. It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders, and they came down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
