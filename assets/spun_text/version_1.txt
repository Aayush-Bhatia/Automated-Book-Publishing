"The Gates of Morning"

CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his eyes cast southward. Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea thundered, spindrift scattering on the wind; before him, the ocean stretched out, calm as a lake, infinite, blue, and flown about by fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin.

Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea in itself, a sea of storm in heavy winds, a lake of azure in light airs—and it was his, all his, who had landed here only yesterday.

The tribe, busy along the beach in the blazing sun, was his people. Women, children, and youths fished with nets, played games, or worked on the paraka patches. His were the canoes drawn up on the sand, and his the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

As he gazed from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow contracted, and, turning his back to the lagoon, he stood facing the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Away there, beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.

Little Tari, the son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral close by, looking up at him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that all the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless and without a man or leader.
