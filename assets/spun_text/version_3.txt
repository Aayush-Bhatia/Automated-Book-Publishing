"The Gates of Morning"

CHAPTER I: THE CANOE BUILDER

Dick stood on a ledge of coral, his gaze cast southward.

Behind him, the breakers of the outer sea thundered, spindrift scattering on the wind; before him, an ocean calm as a lake stretched out, infinite, blue, and dotted with fishing gulls—the lagoon of Karolin. Clipped by its forty-mile ring of coral, this great pond was a sea in itself, turbulent in heavy winds, a lake of azure in light airs—and it was his, his domain, for he who had landed here only yesterday.

The tribe bustled along the beach in the blazing sun, busy with nets, games, and work on the paraka patches. Women, children, and youths—all were his people. The canoes drawn up on the sand belonged to him, as did the empty houses where the war canoes had once rested on their rollers.

As his eyes shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, his brow furrowed. Turning his back to the lagoon, he faced the breakers on the outer beach and the northern sea. Beyond the sea line, invisible, lay Palm Tree, an island as beautiful as a dream, yet swarming with devils.

Little Tari, son of Le Taioi the net maker, sat on the coral nearby, watching him. Tari knew little of life, but he knew that the men of Karolin, swept away by war, had left the women, boys, and children like himself defenseless and without a man or leader.
